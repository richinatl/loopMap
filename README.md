# loopMap

### Description
There were two challenges here. First using Java to build and command line math utility using Java Array Lists and Loops. Second to make a hashmap of a car makes and models searchable from the command lind. The goal is to expand my knowlege and practice. This is one of several small projects in the works as I learn all the ins and outs of Java. Adding each small step, one at a time, to show and document the process I'm using as I learn a new language.
